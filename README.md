### Hi there, I'm CarsonðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent developer passionate about building products that are not just functional, but also thoughtful and intuitive. I believe the best tools get out of your way, and I love the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant, simple solutions.

ðŸ”­ **I'm Currently Building:**

*   **[Prompt Pocket](https://prompt.code-harmony.top)**: A Chrome Extension to streamline the way you store, organize, and invoke prompts. Born from my own frustration, it's designed with a powerful templating engine to make interacting with AI faster and more contextual. *(Recently submitted to the Chrome Web Store!)*
*   **[Nexus](https://github.com/c-w-xiaohei/nexus)**: An open-source framework designed to simplify cross-context development (e.g., for browser extensions, Electron apps, or web workers). The core idea is to hide the complexity of communication, making it feel as simple as native module development.

âš¡ **My Life:**

*   I'm a classical music fanatic, especially Romantic-era piano pieces. I used to lead my university's orchestra, so I'm no stranger to turning chaos into harmony.
